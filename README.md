# Streamlit in Python

This project demonstrates creating interactive web apps using Streamlit in Python.  
It allows quick visualization of data, user inputs, and dynamic dashboards with minimal code.  
Streamlit supports charts, tables, widgets, and real-time updates for data apps.  
The goal is to simplify data exploration and app deployment for non-web developers.
